# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Ricardo"
age = 15
favorite_color = "purple"
favorite_number = 67

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"My name is {first_name} and my favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number



#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
number_1 = int(input("Pick a number "))
number_2 = int(input("Pick another number "))
number_3 = number_1 + number_2
print(f"The sum of the two numebers you picked is {number_3}.")

# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
